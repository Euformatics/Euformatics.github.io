<h1 id="using-the-omnomicsq-command-line-application-docker-image">Using
the omnomicsQ command line application Docker image</h1>
<p>The omnomicsQ Docker image is an alternative way to obtain the
omnomicsQ command-line application. Benefits of using the omnomicsQ
Docker image include that you donâ€™t need to install or configure the
application on your machine, as long as you have a working Docker
installation (including Docker Desktop if you are using Windows or Mac).
Since there is nothing to install, upgrading to a newer version is just
a matter of referencing a newer version number on your command line.</p>
<h2 id="obtaining-the-omnomicsq-docker-image">Obtaining the omnomicsQ
Docker image</h2>
<p>The Docker image is available through the Docker Hub at <a
href="https://hub.docker.com/r/euformatics/omnomicsq_cli/tags">euformatics/omnomicsq_cli</a>.
Check the linked page for the latest available version. The latest
version at the time of writing is 1.1.6. You can pull it to your machine
with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>docker pull euformatics/omnomicsq_cli:1.1.6</code></pre>
<h2
id="running-the-omnomicsq-docker-image-from-the-command-line">Running
the omnomicsQ Docker image from the command line</h2>
<p>The command line application connects to the omnomicsQ server at <a
href="https://q.omnomics.com">q.omnomics.com</a> over HTTPS. A username
and a password are used to authenticate. For testing and occasional
usage, you can use the same username and password that you use to log in
to the web application. For configuring the command line application as
a permanent part of your pipeline, please contact Euformatics support at
<a href="mailto:support@euformatics.com">support@euformatics.com</a> to
obtain another password that is separate from the password you use to
interactively use the application.</p>
<p>Username and password are specified via the <code>oq_org</code> and
<code>oq_license</code> environment variables. You need to specify these
environment variables with the <code>-e</code> command line switch when
you run the command line application.</p>
<p>In the Bash shell on Linux/Mac, you can set the environment variables
with the <code>export</code> command. Replace
<code>&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;</code> and
<code>&lt;YOUR_PASSWORD&gt;</code> with your actual username and
password:</p>
<pre><code>export oq_org=&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;
export oq_license=&lt;YOUR_PASSWORD&gt;</code></pre>
<p>If you are on Windows (using Docker Desktop), in Command Prompt or
PowerShell you will need to use the <code>set</code> command
instead:</p>
<pre><code>set oq_org=&lt;YOUR_USERNAME&gt;
set oq_license=&lt;YOUR_PASSWORD&gt;</code></pre>
<p>To ensure that your username and password are correct, you can now
try using <code>docker run</code> to execute the
<code>omnomicsq_cli list_devices</code> command for listing your
configured devices from the server:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -i -e oq_org -e oq_license euformatics/omnomicsq_cli:1.1.6 /opt/omnomicsq/omnomicsq_cli list_devices</code></pre>
<p>If everything was successful, you will see a list of your
devices.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
<p>You can issue the following command to see the command line help:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -i -e oq_org -e oq_license euformatics/omnomicsq_cli:1.1.6 /opt/omnomicsq/omnomicsq_cli --help</code></pre>
<p>The quick start guide is included as a README file with the docker
image, and it contains example commands for common tasks like analyzing
FASTQ, BAM and VCF files. You can view it with the following
command:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -i -e oq_org -e oq_license euformatics/omnomicsq_cli:1.1.6 cat /opt/omnomicsq/README.md</code></pre>
